I'm thrilled to share with you my journey towards breaking into tech. For a while, I felt like imposter syndrome was holding me back from pursuing my dream. It's not easy to push past those feelings of self-doubt and insecurity, but I refused to give up. That's when I discovered **Empower Her Community Technical Bootcamp 3.0**.

The orientation session for the Empower Her Bootcamp was both thrilling and informative. We met the trainers and facilitators who will guide us through the program and got a preview of what's in store for the next few weeks. Additionally, we received a thorough briefing on the program's timetable, expectations, and prerequisites.

As part of the Empower Her Bootcamp, we will be grouped with "accountability sisters," a concept that promotes camaraderie among participants and encourages mutual support throughout the program. We are responsible for each other's progress and development, holding each other to high standards. This strategy is aimed at keeping us motivated, focused, and dedicated to achieving our objectives. Thus far, it has been an amazing experience, and I consider myself fortunate to have such a supportive community of women on my side. 

 Our timetable for week 1 was released in this format:

We began by getting an overview of the essentials of cloud engineering. I discovered that cloud engineering pertains to the process of creating, designing, and sustaining systems and applications that operate on the cloud. This field encompasses a diverse range of proficiencies and technologies such as cloud computing, security, network architecture, and automation.

Cloud engineers collaborate with various types of cloud environments such as public, private, and hybrid to produce cloud-based solutions that are resilient and scalable and that cater to the requirements of businesses and organizations. They have the responsibility of establishing and executing cloud infrastructure, configuring and deploying cloud services, monitoring and optimizing cloud performance, and ensuring that cloud-based systems are secure and dependable.

The significance of cloud engineering has grown considerably as more businesses transfer their applications and data to the cloud. Cloud engineers have a critical role in enabling companies to leverage the advantages of cloud computing, including flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

We were made the know the categories of **Cloud delivery models** which inclde:

- PaaS
- SaaS
- IaaS

Platform as a Service (PaaS): is a cloud computing model where developers can create and launch applications without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure. In this approach, the cloud providers provide a platform that includes tools and services for application development, testing, deployment, hosting, and scaling.

Software as a Service (SaaS) refers to a cloud computing model where software applications are provided by cloud providers through the internet, typically through a subscription-based model. Users can use the software through a web browser or mobile app, without needing to install or take care of the software themselves. The cloud provider handles the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):  is a cloud computing model in which virtualized computing resources such as servers, storage, networking, and operating systems are provided by cloud providers over the internet. This allows users to personalize their computing environment by running their own applications and services on top of the infrastructure provided.

The cloud delivery models provide users with varying degrees of control, flexibility, and management options, depending on their specific requirements and preferences. Each model offers its own unique set of features and benefits, which can be tailored to suit the needs of different users. For instance, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offers users a high level of control over their virtualized computing resources, while Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides a more streamlined and managed platform for users to develop and deploy their applications. Meanwhile, Software as a Service (SaaS) offers users a complete software solution that can be accessed and used over the internet, without the need for installation or maintenance. Ultimately, users must weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each cloud delivery model to determine which one best suits their needs and preferences.
